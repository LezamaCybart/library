## Library
This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum:(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library)
Small Library app.

## Functionality
- All the book objects in the "myLibrary" array are displayed in a list, with their respective title name, author, page count and read status.
- Clicking on "Add Book" will bring a popup form, allowing users to input the details for the new book.
- Each book's display has a "delete book" to remove the book from the library.
- Each book's display has a button that allows the user to change its read status.
- Using the web local storage API the library saves data on the user's computer.

## Thoughts
The project ended up taking longer than I expected, my solutions were overcomplicated at first, so I had to start from scratch at some point.
The project was an excellent practice for interactions between the script and HTML, DOM manipulation, and I also got to work with new concepts 
like local storage and a little of OOP.

## TODO
-Besides for the minimum needed to make the form a popup form, the app lacks any style, The Odin Project curriculum has a whole html and css chapter,
so I'll wait until I get there and learn something, so I can come back and make the app prettier, for now I'm only focusing on the JavaScript side of things.  
-I could have used Firebase or other service for storage, but then again, the curriculum has a BaaS chapter. I'll come back and implement all the new things
that I learn along the way.
